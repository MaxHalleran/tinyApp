# Tiny App - Link Shortener

This is an application that allows you to organize and edit shortened links.

## Current development

Currently I am adding:

-Personalized links, allowing links to be 'owned' by a user who can edit and delete them while allowing other users the ability to still use the shortened link.

## Current function:

-Routing: moving all my routes to a seperate file
-Module: moving all my server functionality to a seperate file to keep it discrete and clean
